# Analysing-Employee-Performance-for-Hr-Analytics-Using-Python-and-MySQL
In this project, I worked on a real-world dataset of the Employee's records. This project intends to evaluate the provided dataset, solve business problems on this dataset, and mine information insights. 

Project consist of 2 modules.
# Module 1 : Data Preprocessing using Python

Step 1: Removing duplicate rows.

Step 2: Removing rows for which numeric columns are having irrelevant data type values

Step 3: Remove irrelevant values from each column if any. Validation all values for a column, Check for any inconsistencies or discrepancies in data types, units, or formats.Feel free to add more validation checks which you might feel necessary for the datasetâ€™s integrity

Step 4: Export the cleaned dataset as a .csv file: prefer UTF-8 encoding.

Step 5: Convert the pre-processed dataset into an SQL file.

Step 6: Manually generate a table by utilizing the database information provided in the "Database Info" tab.


# Module 2 : Data Analysis using MySQL
In this module, I worked on performing data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module and conducted Data Analysis using MySQL. I generated queries for given problem statements.
