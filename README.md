# Analysing-Employee-Performance-for-Hr-Analytics-Using-Python-and-MySQL
* Worked on a real-world dataset of employee records from HR resources, focusing on data preprocessing using Python. Tasks included removing duplicates,
* validating values for each column, and checking for inconsistencies or discrepancies in data types, units, or formats.
* Derived insights from HR data, emphasizing factors such as average training scores, previous year's ratings, length of service, and awards won.
* Created a comprehensive Power BI report based on the cleaned data for effective data visualization. 

Project consist of 2 modules.
# Module 1 : Data Preprocessing using Python
Step 1: Removing duplicate rows.
Step 2: Removing rows for which numeric columns are having irrelevant data type values
Step 3: Remove irrelevant values from each column if any. Validation all values for a column, Check for any inconsistencies or discrepancies in data types, units, or formats.Feel free to add more validation checks which you might feel necessary for the datasetâ€™s integrity
Step 4: Export the cleaned dataset as a .csv file: prefer UTF-8 encoding.
Step 5: Convert the pre-processed dataset into an SQL file.
Step 6: Manually generate a table by utilizing the database information provided in the "Database Info" tab.

# Module 2 : Data Analysis using MySQL
In this module, I worked on performing data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module and conducted Data Analysis using MySQL. I generated queries for given problem statements.
